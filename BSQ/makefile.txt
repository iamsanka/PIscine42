Structures:

t_map_info: Stores map metadata (number of lines, empty, obstacle, full characters).
t_square: Stores the largest squareâ€™s size, and its top-right corner position.
Helper Functions:

Basic utility functions (ft_putchar, ft_putstr, etc.).
ft_malloc: Allocates memory with error handling.
parse_map_info: Parses the first line to retrieve the map information.
validate_map: Checks if the map conforms to the rules (same line length, correct characters, etc.).
find_largest_square: Uses dynamic programming to locate the largest square.
fill_square: Marks the largest square on the map using the full character.
print_map: Prints the processed map with the filled square.
Main Logic:

File Reading: Reads the file content into a buffer, splits it into lines, and validates the map.
Square Finding: Computes the largest square and modifies the map.
Error Handling: Prints errors for invalid maps.
Multiple Files: Handles multiple files as input.
